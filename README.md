## Description

Build a [Tetris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris) game in the browser using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the [jQuery][jquery] library.

Fork the the [browser-games repository][browser-games] and use the fork as your project artifact. It is recommended that you follow along with this tutorial: https://github.com/jonhoo/tetris-tutorial/.

Implement the **Tetris** game from the list in the [games.md][games-list] file.

## Context

This goal will challenge your ability to take a _formal, defined system_ from the real world and replicate it in code. You will start with all of the logic of the system (the rules of the game) and most of the UI already designed.

Your work will be mainly in deciding how to replicate that formal logic and user interface using JavaScript + jQuery, HTML, and CSS.
